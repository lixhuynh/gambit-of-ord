**Fork of the Storm**, a variant of the Gambit of Ord, is a card game introduced in the D&D podcast "Critical Role." For fun, I decided to implement it in C.

# Mechanics

- Round 1: Players roll a D8 and keep the results hidden.
- Round 2: Players roll a D6 and make the results known.
- Round 3: Players roll a D4 and make the results known.
- Final Round: All results are revealed, and duplicate rolls allow an extra D4 to be rolled.
